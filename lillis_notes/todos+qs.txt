Q?????

minilibx or mlx?

who doing which parts?
	maybe at start:
		 one person: map parsing + validation
		 other person: raytracing + rendering walls 
	and then left:
			textures, floor, ceiling 
			player movement





how are parts connected? structs?




structs pitch :

main struct: (storing everything important, easy freeing in case of error)
	mlx
	window
	map: 2D array (char **)
	player ptr
	...

player:
	FOV (field of view)
	position
	direction
