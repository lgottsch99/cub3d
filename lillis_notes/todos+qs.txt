Q?????

minilibx or mlx?

who doing which parts?
	maybe at start:
		 one person: map parsing + validation
		 other person: raytracing


how are parts connected? structs?
	what info does raytracing need from map? 

	->keep program struct with everything malloced for easy freeing
	inside after map parsing:
	info (2d array) map
	info player position etc
	...
