CUB3D

4 total parts:
	1 map initialization + window creation
	2 casting the rays
	3 rendering walls
	4 player movement



1 map initialization + window creation (=foundation for rest of project)
	init mlx library, create window
	parse + validate map file
	malloc mem to store map info


2 casting the rays
	creates illusion of depth

		raycasting steps:
		1 calculate ray direction
		2 calc delta distance
		3 calc step and side distance
		4 differential analysis
		5 calc wall height


3 rendering walls
	rendering scene (while using  map layout, player position, raycasting result, textures,... )
	(idea: start untextured for testing, when working add textures)

4 player movement (= re rendering of scene?)
	handles movement + rotation within game world
